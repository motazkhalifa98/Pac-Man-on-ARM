0. I removed switches_handler from all files
1. only remaining steps is using 2 timers, speed up timers, and eating ghosts score

to-do list:
-add instructions to game	-> COMPLETED
-have a functional timerB
-at start of timerA, we check flag 1-->move_pacman, 2-->move_ghosts_afraid, 3-->print pause menu    ->partially completed
-at start of timerB, we check flag 1-->move_ghosts_hostile, 2-->move_pacman, 3-->print pause menu   ->partially completed
-have a functional switch handler that sets flag for print pause menu 	-> COMPLETED
-have a subroutine that prints the pause menu				-> COMPLETED
-modify the UART to accept presses of q and r *ONLY* when pause menu is up, to either leave or continue game.	-> COMPLETED		
-get the power pellets operational 					->partially completed
-modify timer flag to 2 until power pellet is no longer working        ->COMPLETED
-make sure afraid ghost goes back in box when eaten (and stays there)	-> COMPLETED
-set up decremented counter of 16 for when power pellet is eaten in 0.5 timer	-> COMPLETED
-score counter for eating ghosts
-create a subroutine that speeds up the game	
-create a "GAMEOVER" subroutine						-> I don't think we need this
