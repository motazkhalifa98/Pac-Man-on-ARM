Question: When pacman is being chase, can he escape without eating a power pellet?
    -I think he will get caught in 5 seconds
Question: How does ghosts leave box?



Timer 1 at rate of 2 moves per second:
    -->Checks first who is being chased
    --> Pacman -> Move Pacman
    --> Ghost  -> Move Ghosts


Timer 2 at rate of 3 moves per second:
    -->Checks first who is chasing
    --> Same thing as above

Chase controller:
    --> if power pellet is eaten
    --> Switch speeds
    --> set timer for 8 secs (idk how yet) before switching back



Ghosts
    --> Each has its location stored somewhere in memory
    --> Move one by one in the board before printing the whole board
    Move: (For ghost 1,2,3,4)
    -Move Ghost 1
    -Move Ghost 2
    -Move Ghost 3
    -Move Ghost 4
        Move:
        -Check surronding, first check if pacman exists in any of the locations RIGHT to the ghost,
        If so, set direction to 1.
        -If down, direction = 2
        -If left, direction = 3
        -If up, direction = 4
        -If neither, set direction to random number between 1 and 4.
        -Else (between 1 & 4), if pacman isn't powered, go to that direction
        -If pacman is powered, go to opposite direction,
        if there is obstacle in opposite direction, choose any other direction except the one for pacman.
        -Check whatever is in that direction for the ghost
            -If empty -> go ahead and move ghost in direction
            -If star (pellet), set flag so that we would put a pellet back in after the second move.
            -If pacman is empowered, ghost dies, if pacman isn't, pacman dies.
            -Else (if it is not empty, star or pacman then it is an obstacle), regenerate random number
            and repeat loop to check again.
            -Also note that ghosts CANNOT go back into the box in the middle of the board
            unless they die, otherwise they should NEVER get inside even by random number generator

Pacman
    --> Follows user's directions through UART
    --> Number of pellets is finite, we should keep count of it so that we could know if level is completed
    --> If Pacman ate a pellet
        -Add 10 points
        -Decrease pellets counter by 1.
        -Replace pellet by pacman in board
        -Check if pellets number = 0 --> Level passed
            --> Start a new level with faster clockrate
    --> If Pacman hit a ghost
        -He dies, one life decreases (not sure if the board resets)
        -If pacman is empowered
            -For the first ghost while power pellet is active, 100 pts, then 200, 400,800
            -Ghost goes back to center and stays there until power pellet effect goes away (8sec)
    --> If Pacman ate a power pellet
        - Replace it with pacman
        - Se counter (idk how yet) to 8 seconds
        - Switch speeds
    --> If pacman went to the left and it was in the middle of the board
        - Show up from other side, with direction = left
    --> If pacman went to the right and it was in the middle of the board
        - Show up from other side, with direction = right
    --> If Empty slot, no pellets
        - Move normally
    --> If none of the above (obstace), remain at same location
