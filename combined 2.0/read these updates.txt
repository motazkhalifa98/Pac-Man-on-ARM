0. I splitted the code between the lab_7 and library
	*Library doesn't have any pointers and should be kept that way
1. I put move_hostile_ghost and move_pacman in same timer
until other timer is active.
2. RGB LED works good for amount of lives, and lives do decrease
3. When pacman is eaten, board resets perfectly
4. when pacman finishes the level, board reset perfectly
5. when pacman goes through right exit, shows up on left and other way
6. POWER PELLET IS NOT ACTIVE YET, it only turns RGB LED to blue
7. afraid ghosts work good escaping-wise and printing
8. afraid ghosts still need to have subroutine for when eaten
9. When pacman loses 3 lives, it still needs endgame subroutine

to-do list:
-add instructions to game
-have a functional timerB
-at start of timerA, we check flag 1-->move_pacman, 2-->move_ghosts_afraid, 3-->print pause menu    ->partially completed
-at start of timerB, we check flag 1-->move_ghosts_hostile, 2-->move_pacman, 3-->print pause menu   ->partially completed
-have a functional switch handler that sets flag for print pause menu 	-> COMPLETED
-have a subroutine that prints the pause menu				-> COMPLETED
-modify the UART to accept presses of q and r *ONLY* when pause menu is up, to either leave or continue game.	-> COMPLETED		
-get the power pellets operational 					->partially completed
-modify timer flag to 2 until power pellet is no longer working
-make sure afraid ghost goes back in box when eaten (and stays there)
-set up decremented counter of 16 for when power pellet is eaten in 0.5 timer	-> COMPLETED
-score counter for eating ghosts
-create a subroutine that speeds up the game
-create a "GAMEOVER" subroutine						-> I don't think we need this
