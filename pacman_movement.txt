The start up code needs to have these lines:

TimerPacman_Handler,                  // Timer 0 subtimer A
TimerGhost_Handler,                   // Timer 0 subtimer B

Let Timer 0's Timer A be for Pacman
Let Timer 0's Timer B be for the ghosts




PacMan's movement is inputted through the UART Handler
w, a, s, d are used to control directions
Movement is similar to Lab6 Snake Game.

In memory, there will be a direction flag. It is the same as Lab6.
Direction flag:
  Right: 1
  Left: 2
  Up: 3
  Down: 4


The act of moving PacMan is done in the Timer0_Handler subroutine.
  In this subroutine, it checks what the value in the direction register is
  -> Check the character in that direction
      -> if up, check character that is above the current location
  -> if character is valid space, update current location
