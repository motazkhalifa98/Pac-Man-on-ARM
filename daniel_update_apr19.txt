Update and Notes

- The start up code file now has these handlers:
    TimerGhost_Handler
    TimerPacman_Handler
    Switches_Handler
    UART0_Handler

- UART0_Handler:
    - made w a s d the controls
    - left blank: pause function/ if user presses p

- TimerPacman_Handler -> I chose to use Timer A for the PacMan, Timer B for ghosts
    - if the next location is a wall/corner
        - keep Pacman stationary
        - keep the current location
        - print update
    - if the next location is a normal pellet
        - update new location with PacMan (<)
        - update old location with space
        - left blank: code to increase score
        - print update
    - if the next location is a power pellet
        - update new location with PacMan (<)
        - update old location with space
        - left blank: code to increase score
        - left blank: changing hostile ghost to afraid ghost
        - left blank: setting timer for 8 seconds
        - print update
        - print update
    - if the next location is a space
        - update new location with PacMan (<)
        - update old location with space
        - made a note of NOT increasing the score
    - if the next location is a hostile ghost
        - left blank: PacMan should be moved back to center/starting position
        - left blank: Ghosts should be moved back to the box
        - left blank: code to decrease life by 1
        - left blank: if there was to be 0 life left, game over
        - print update
    - if the next location is an afraid ghost
        - question: what should happen? does the ghost teleport back into the box?
        - question: should the location be updated with the space?
        - left blank: code to update score
        - left blank: code to put ghosts back in the box
        - left blank: code to not let the ghosts out until 8 seconds
        - print update


Ideas:
    Hostile ghosts: M
    Afraid ghosts: W

    If PacMan runs into a wall, then PacMan stays there, not moving, until the user moves PacMan into a valid direction
