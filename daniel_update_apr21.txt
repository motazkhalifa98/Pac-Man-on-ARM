Update and Notes

  - put everything into my Code Composure Studio
  - my current Code Composure Studio is in the files: "in_use...."
  - organized the .global and ptr_to... lines
  - in the Start up file...
      - included UART0_Handler, TimerPacman_Handler
      - commented out Switches_Handler, TimerGhost_Handler
  - included direction flag: left, right, up, down
  - included led flag: 3 lives, 2 lives, 1 life, and 4 for power pellet
  - included initial_print: initial board, level, and score

  NOTE:
    - printing out the score and level numbers need to be modified (i did not
      change to ASCII)

    Still need to include:
    - the condition to check if game should be over (in the infinite loop)
    - TimerGhost_Handler (use timerB_interrupt_clear)
    - the code to increase score
    - the code to do SOMETHING with the push buttons

  QUESTION:
    -in lab 6, print_update (where it prints out the new board) is at the end of
    the timer handler
    -in this lab, since we have 2 timer handlers, I was thinking that maybe
    it should go in the infinite loop?


  ERRORS:
  - "unresolved symbols remain": I don't understand how to solve these? CCS
  doesn't tell me exactly where it happens
